# portfolio-project
hi all, i recently started learning gtml and here is the small web-page i have created of all the things that i have learned during my journey. 
This is a beginner-level portfolio, but I’m proud of these small milestones as they mark important steps in my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. I’ll be updating this repository with more projects as I continue learning.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio — feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
